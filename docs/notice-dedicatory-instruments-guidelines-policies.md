Section 202.007 of the Texas Property Code provides that a property owners' association may not enforce a provision in a dedicatory instrument that prohibits or restricts a property Owner from installing rain barrels or a rain harvesting system on the property Owner's Lot. However, Section 202.007 of the Texas Property Code further provides that a property owners' association is not required to permit a rain barrel or rainwater harvesting system to be installed on a Lot in particular circumstances or restricted from regulating rain barrels and rain harvesting devices in specified manners. The following Guidelines shall be applicable to rain barrels and rain harvesting systems in The Reserve at Kings Point:

* **2.1. ACC Approval.** In order to confirm the proposed rain barrel or rain harvesting device is in compliance with these Guidelines, Owners are encouraged to apply to the ACC for prior approval. The Association may require an Owner to remove a rain barrel or rain harvesting device that does not comply with requirements of these Guidelines.
* **2.2. Location.** A rain barrel or rain harvesting system is not permitted on a Lot between the front of the residential dwelling on the Lot and an adjacent street.
* **2.3. Color and Display.** A rain barrel or rain harvesting system is not permitted:
    * a. unless the color of the rain barrel or rain harvesting system is consistent with the color scheme of the residential dwelling on the Owner's Lot; or
    * b. if the rain barrel or rain harvesting system displays any language or other content that is not typically displayed by the rain barrel or rain harvesting system as it is manufactured.
* **2.4. Regulations if Visible.** If a rain barrel or rain harvesting system is located on the side of the residential dwelling on the Lot or at any other location on the Lot that is visible from a street, another Lot, or a common area, the rain barrel or rain harvesting system must comply with the following regulations:
    * **a. Rain Barrel:**
        * (i) **Size:** A maximum height of forty-two (42) inches and a maximum capacity of fifty (50) gallons.
        * (ii) **Type:** A rain barrel that has the appearance of an authentic barrel and is either entirely round or has a flat back to fit flush against a wall. A rain barrel must have a manufactured top or cap to prevent or deter the breeding of mosquitoes.
        * (iii) **Materials:** Wood, metal, polyethylene or plastic resin designed to look like an authentic barrel in brown or other earthtone color.
        * (iv) **Screening:** The rain barrel must be screened with evergreen landscaping to minimize its visibility from a street, another Lot, and common area, unless otherwise approved in writing by the ACC.
        * (v) **Downspout:** The downspout which provides water to the rain barrel must be the same color and material as the gutters on the residential dwelling, if any. Further, the downspout must be vertical and attached to the wall against which the rain barrel is located.

The portion of a rain harvesting system that is above-ground must appear to be a landscape or water feature. The above-ground portion of the rain harvesting system shall not extend above the surface of the ground by more than thirty-six (36) inches. The above-ground portion of the rain harvesting system must be screened with evergreen landscaping to minimize visibility from a street, another Lot, and common area, unless otherwise approved in writing by the ACC.
    * Provided that, the regulations in this Section 2.4 shall be applicable only to the extent that they do not prohibit the economic installation of the rain barrel or rain harvesting system on the Lot and there is a reasonably sufficient area on the Lot in which to install the rain barrel or rain harvesting system.

### Section 3. Solar Energy Devices.

Section 202.010 of the Texas Property Code provides that a property owners' association may not enforce a provision in a dedicatory instrument that prohibits or restricts a property Owner from installing a solar energy device except as otherwise provided therein. As used in Section 202.010 of the Texas Property Code, "solar energy device" has the meaning assigned by Section 171.107 of the Tax Code, which defines the term as "a system or series of mechanisms designed primarily to provide heating or cooling or to produce electrical or mechanical power by collecting and transferring solar generated power". The term includes a mechanical or chemical device that has the ability to store solar-generated energy for use in heating or cooling or in the production of power. The following Guidelines shall be applicable to solar energy devices in The Reserve at Kings Point:

* **3.1. ACC Approval.** The installation of a solar energy device requires the prior written approval of the ACC. Provided that, the ACC may not withhold approval if these Guidelines are met or exceeded, unless the ACC determines in writing that placement of the device as proposed constitutes a condition that substantially interferes with the use and enjoyment of land by causing unreasonable discomfort or annoyance to persons of ordinary sensibilities. The written approval of the proposed placement of the device by all Owners of property adjoining the Lot in question constitutes prima facie evidence that substantial interference does not exist.
* **3.2. Location.** A solar energy device is not permitted anywhere on a Lot except on the roof of the residential dwelling or other permitted structure on the Lot or in a fenced yard or patio within the Lot.
* **3.3. Devices Mounted on a Roof.** A solar energy device mounted on the roof of the residential dwelling or other permitted structure on a Lot:
    * a. shall not extend higher than or beyond the roofline;
    * b. shall conform to the slope of the roof and have a top edge that is parallel to the roofline;
    * c. shall have frames, support brackets and/or visible piping or wiring that are silver, bronze or black tone, as commonly available in the marketplace; and
    * d. shall be located on the roof as designated by the ACC unless an alternate location increases the estimated annual energy production of the device by more than ten percent (10%) above the energy production of the device if located in the area designated by the ACC. For determining estimated annual energy production, the parties shall use a publicly available modeling tool provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
* **3.4. Visibility.** A solar energy device located in a fenced yard or patio shall not be taller than or extend above the fence enclosing the yard or patio.
* **3.5. Warranties.** A solar energy device shall not be installed on a Lot in a manner that voids material warranties.
* **3.6. Limitations.** A solar energy device is not permitted on a Lot if, as adjudicated by a court, it threatens the public health or safety or violates a law.

### Section 4. Storm and Energy Efficient Shingles.

Section 202.011 of the Texas Property Code provides that a property owners' association may not enforce a provision in a dedicatory instrument that prohibits or restricts a property Owner from installing shingles that:
* **a. are designed to:**
    * (i) be wind and hail resistant;
    * (ii) provide heating and cooling efficiencies greater than those provided by customary composition shingles; or
    * (iii) provide solar generation capabilities; and
* **b. when installed:**
    * (i) resemble the shingles used or otherwise authorized for use on property in the subdivision;
    * (ii) are more durable than and are of equal or superior quality to the shingles described below; and
    * (iii) match the aesthetics of the property surrounding the Owner's property.

* **4.1. ACC Approval.** In order to confirm the proposed shingles conform to the foregoing Guidelines, Owners are encouraged to apply to the ACC for prior approval. The Association may require an Owner to remove shingles that do not comply with these Guidelines.
* **4.2. Regulations.** When installed, storm and energy efficient shingles must resemble, be more durable than, and be of equal or superior quality to the types of shingles otherwise required or authorized for use in the Section of The Reserve at Kings Point where the Lot is located, as required by the applicable sections of the Declaration to the Lot. In addition, the storm or energy efficient shingles must match the aesthetics of the Lots surrounding the Lot in question.

### Section 5. Flags.

Section 202.011 of the Texas Property Code provides that a property owners' association may not enforce a provision in a dedicatory instrument that prohibits, restricts, or has the effect of prohibiting or restricting a flag of the United States of America, the flag of the State of Texas, or an official or replica flag of any branch of the United States armed forces, except as otherwise provided therein. The following Guidelines shall be applicable to flagpoles and the three (3) types of flags listed in Section 202.011 of the Texas Property Code:

* **5.1. ACC Approval.** Above-ground flagpoles, flagpole stands and/or footings and illumination under Section 5.6 proposed to be placed in front of the front building setback line for a Lot or outside of any other recorded setbacks must be approved by the ACC. In order to confirm a proposed flagpole conforms to the following standards, Owners are encouraged to apply to the ACC for prior approval for all other flagpoles (freestanding or attached). The Association may require an Owner to remove flagpoles, flagpole footings, or flags that do not comply with these Guidelines.
* **5.2. Flag of the United States.** The flag of the United States must be displayed in accordance with applicable provisions of 4 U.S.C. Sections 5-10, which address, among other things, the time and occasions for display, the position and manner of display, and respect for the flag.
* **5.3.

* **5.4. Flagpoles.**
    * a. Not more than one (1) freestanding flagpole or flagpole attached to the residential dwelling or garage (on a permanent or temporary basis) is permitted on a Lot, which may not exceed five inches (5") in diameter, without the approval of the ACC.
    * b. A freestanding flagpole shall not exceed twenty (20) feet in height, measured from the ground to the highest point of the flagpole.
    * c. A flagpole attached to the residential dwelling or garage shall not exceed six (6) feet in length.
    * d. A flagpole, whether freestanding or attached to the residential dwelling or garage, must be constructed of permanent, long-lasting materials with a finish appropriate to materials used in the construction of the flagpole and harmonious with the residential dwelling on the Lot on which it is located.
    * e. A flagpole shall not be located in an easement or encroach into an easement.
    * f. A freestanding flagpole shall not be located nearer to a property line of the Lot than the applicable setbacks as either shown on the recorded plat or as set forth in the Declaration. Provided a freestanding flagpole may be located up to five feet (5') in front of the front building setback line for a Lot, if any above-ground stands and/or footings are approved in accordance with Section 5.1.

* **5.7. Noise.** An external halyard on a flagpole is required to be securely affixed to the flagpole so that it is not moved by the wind and thereby permitted to clang against the flagpole.

### Section 6. Religious Items.

Section 202.018 of the Texas Property Code provides that a property owners' association may not enforce or adopt a restrictive covenant that prohibits a property Owner or resident from displaying or affixing on the entry to the Owner's or resident's dwelling one or more religious items, the display of which is motivated by the Owner's or resident's sincere religious belief, except as otherwise provided therein. Section 202.001(4) of the Texas Property Code defines "restrictive covenant" to mean any covenant, condition, or restriction contained in a dedicatory instrument. The following Guidelines shall be applicable to the display of religious items in The Reserve at Kings Point:

# PAYMENT PLAN POLICY for THE RESERVE AT KINGS POINT COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION

**THE STATE OF TEXAS**
**COUNTY OF HARRIS**

I, Joseph Mazzerella, President of The Reserve at Kings Point Community Association (the "Association"), do hereby certify that at a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Association (the "Board") duly called and held on the 20 day of December, 2011, with at least a quorum of the board members being present and remaining throughout, and being duly authorized to transact business, the following Payment Plan Policy was duly approved by a majority vote of the members of the Board:

**RECITALS:**

1.  Chapter 209 of the Texas Property Code was amended to add Section 209.0062 to require property owners' associations to adopt reasonable guidelines to establish an alternative payment schedule by which an Owner may make partial payments for delinquent regular or special assessments or any other amount owed to the Association without accruing additional monetary penalties.
2.  The new law relating to alternative payment schedules (i.e., payment plans) becomes effective on January 1, 2012.
3.  The Board of Directors of the Association desires to adopt a payment plan policy consistent with the provisions of Section 209.0062 of the Texas Property Code.

**POLICY:**

It is the policy of the Association to provide an alternative payment schedule by which an Owner may make payments to the Association for delinquent regular or special assessments or other amounts owed to the Association without accruing additional monetary penalties, as follows:

* **1. Applicability.** This policy only applies to delinquent regular assessments, special assessments or other amounts owed the Association prior to the debt being turned over to a "collection agent" as that term is defined by Section 209.0064 of the Texas Property Code.
* **2. Term.** The term for a payment plan offered by the Association shall be a minimum of three (3) months and a maximum of six (6) months. The Owner shall determine whether the payment plan shall be for the maximum term of six (6) months or a shorter term.
* **3. Payment Plan Agreement.** The Owner shall be obligated to execute a payment plan agreement ("Payment Plan Agreement") which sets forth the total amount to be paid, the term of the payment plan, the due date for and amount of each payment, and the address to which payments are to be mailed or delivered. A payment plan shall not be effective until the Owner executes the required Payment Plan Agreement.
* **4. Sums Included in Plan.** The payment plan shall include all delinquent regular and/or special assessments and other sums owed to the Association as of the effective date of the Payment Plan Agreement. The payment plan shall not include any assessments which have not become due and payable to the Association as of the effective date of the Payment Plan Agreement. The Payment Plan Agreement shall provide that any assessments or other valid charges that become due and payable to the Association per the dedicatory instruments of the Association during the term of the payment plan must be paid in a timely manner.
* **5. Grace Period.** There will be a grace period of three (3) business days from the due date for a payment. If a payment is not received at the address set forth in the Payment Plan Agreement by the close of business on the third (3rd) business day following the date on which the payment is due, the Owner shall be deemed to be in default of the Payment Plan Agreement.
* **6. Administrative Costs and Interest.** The Association shall add to the delinquent assessments and other amounts owed to the Association to be paid in accordance with the Payment Plan Agreement reasonable costs for administering the payment plan, as follows: $20.00 for the preparation of a Payment Plan Agreement and $5.00 for receiving, documenting and processing each payment. During the term of the payment plan, interest at the rate provided in the Declaration or by law shall continue to accrue on delinquent assessments.
* **7. Monthly Penalties.** During the term of the payment plan, the Association shall not impose any monetary penalties with respect to the delinquent assessments and other charges included in the payment plan, except as provided in Section 6. Monetary penalties include late charges and fees otherwise charged by the management company and/or Association and added to the Owner's account as a result of the account being delinquent, if any.
* **8. Default.** If an Owner fails to make a payment to the Association by the end of the grace period applicable to the due date for that payment, the Owner shall be in default of the Payment Plan Agreement, at which point the Payment Plan Agreement shall automatically become void. The Association may notify the Owner that the Payment Plan Agreement is void as a result of the Owner's default, but notice to the Owner shall not be a prerequisite for the Payment Plan Agreement to become void. If the Association receives a payment after the expiration of the grace period and before the Association notifies the Owner that the Payment Plan Agreement is void, the Association may accept the payment and apply it to the Owner's account. The acceptance of a payment made by an Owner after the Payment Plan Agreement has become void shall not reinstate the Payment Plan Agreement.
* **9. Owners Not Eligible for a Payment Plan.** The Association is not required to enter into a payment plan with an Owner who failed to honor the terms of a previous payment plan during the two (2) years following the Owner's default under the previous payment plan.

I hereby certify that I am the duly elected, qualified and acting President of the Association and that the foregoing Payment Plan Policy was approved by a majority vote of the Board of Directors as set forth above and now appears in the books and records of the Association, to be effective upon recording in the Official Public Records of Real Property of Harris County, Texas.

# BILLING AND COLLECTION POLICY for THE RESERVE AT KINGS POINT COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION

**THE STATE OF TEXAS**
**COUNTY OF HARRIS**

I, Joseph Mazzerella, President of The Reserve at Kings Point Community Association (the "Association"), certify that at a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Association (the "Board") duly called and held on the 25 day of MARCH 2012, with at least a quorum of the Board members being present and remaining throughout, and being duly authorized to transact business, the following Billing and Collection Policy was duly approved by a majority vote of the members of the Board:

**RECITALS:**

1.  New laws relating to the collection of assessments by property owners' associations become effective on January 1, 2012.
2.  The Board of Directors of the Association desires to adopt a Billing and Collection Policy consistent with new laws and the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions applicable to the various sections of The Reserve at Kings Point.

**POLICY:**

It is the policy of the Association to collect annual assessments which are not paid in a timely manner as follows:

* **1. Statements for assessments.** The Association shall send a statement for the annual maintenance assessment to each Owner no later than March 1st of each year. The statement shall be forwarded to an Owner at the last known mailing address of the Owner according to the records of the Association. It is the responsibility of the Owner to notify the Association in writing of a change in the Owner's mailing address. The submission of a check which sets forth an address for the Owner that is different from the mailing address previously provided by the Owner to the Association does not constitute written notice of a change of the Owner's mailing address.
* **2. Due Date.** Annual maintenance assessments are due on April 1st of each year. An annual maintenance assessment which is not received by the Association by April 31st of the year in which the annual maintenance assessment becomes due shall be deemed to be delinquent and shall bear interest at the highest legal, non-usurious rate from the original due date (April 1st) until paid. A reasonable late fee in an amount to be determined by the Board may also be charged to the Owner of the property for which the annual maintenance assessment becomes delinquent.
* **3. Payments.** The Association may allow Owners to pay annual maintenance assessments which have not become delinquent over time, so long as the payment plan is approved and the Owner signs the Association's payment agreement. Payments must be made at least on a monthly basis. A fee of $5.00 will be charged for receiving and processing each payment.
* **4. Application of Payments.** A payment received from an Owner shall be applied in the following order of priority:
    * a. any delinquent assessment (annual assessment or special assessment);
    * b. any current assessment (annual assessment or special assessment);
    * c. any attorney's fees or third party collection costs incurred by the Association solely with assessments or any other charges that could provide the basis for foreclosure (i.e., charges secured by the Association's lien);
    * d. any attorney's fees incurred by the Association that are not associated with assessments;
    * e. any fines assessed by the Association; and
    * f. any other amounts owed to the Association.
* **5. Insufficient Check.** If an Owner submits a check in payment of all or some portion of the Owner's assessment account and the check is returned unpaid due to insufficient funds in the account, future payments of sums owed to the Association must be made by cashier's check or money order. The sum of $25.00 shall be charged to an Owner for a check returned due to insufficient funds.
* **6. Notices.** If an account becomes delinquent, a collection letter will be sent to the Owner of the property, the cost of which will be added to the Owner's assessment account. If an account remains delinquent on or after May 1st of the year in which the annual maintenance assessment becomes due, a Delinquency Notice shall be sent to the Owner. The Delinquency Notice shall be sent to the Owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall:
    * a. specify each delinquent amount and the total amount of the payment required to make the account current;
    * b. advise the Owner of the availability of a payment plan in accordance with the Association's recorded Payment Plan Policy;
    * c. provide a period of at least thirty (30) days to cure the delinquency before further collection action is taken; and
    * d. advise the Owner that if, after the thirty (30) day period has expired, the Owner has not entered into a payment plan and account remains delinquent, the account will be referred to the Association's attorney and any fees and costs thereafter incurred by the Association will be added to the Owner's account in accordance with the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions.
* **7. Suspension of Privileges.** If an Owner's assessment account becomes delinquent, the Association may also suspend the Owner's right to use the recreational facilities of the Association after giving written notice to the Owner in accordance with Section 209.006 of the Texas Property Code. The suspension of an Owner's right to use the recreational facilities of the Association shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, all other remedies available to the Association for non-payment of assessments.
* **8. Attorney Action.** If, after a Delinquency Notice is sent to an Owner, the Owner fails to respond to request a payment plan or pay the amount required to make the account current within thirty (30) days, the account will be referred to the Association's attorney for collection. The Association's attorney will forward a thirty (30) day demand for payment to the Owner, which demand shall also advise the Owner that the failure to pay the amount due may result in further legal action, including foreclosure of the Association's lien. Provided that, action to foreclose the Association's lien shall not be commenced unless authorized by the Board of Directors of the Association.
* **9. Payment Plan.** Any payment plan entered into by and between the Association and an Owner after an account becomes delinquent shall be in accordance with the Association's recorded Payment Plan Policy.

I hereby certify that I am the duly elected, qualified and acting President of the Association and that the foregoing Billing and Collection Policy was approved by a majority vote of the Board of Directors as set forth above and now appears in the books and records of the Association, to be effective upon recording in the Official Public Records of Real Property of Harris County, Texas.
