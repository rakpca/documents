### OVERVIEW

The purpose of architectural review is to keep the community attractive for the enjoyment of residents and for the protection of property and property values. The Protective Covenants authorize the Community Association Board of Directors, and Architectural Control Committee (ACC) to make fair interpretations and provide for the uniform enforcement of rules, standards and procedures for the orderly development and maintenance of The Reserve at Kings Point.

The Protective Covenants require homeowners to obtain written approval from the ACC for any new structures, changes, additions, or other improvements to the exterior of their property. This is to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Protective Covenants.

The ACC has established these Guidelines in accordance with the authority granted to it by the Community Association Board of Directors and the provisions of the Protective Covenants. These Guidelines have been established to assure uniform and fair application of the Protective Covenants and are intended to provide all lot owners in The Reserve at Kings Point with information about:
* The type, color and quality of materials which may be used in the exterior maintenance of the property;
* The type, color and quality of materials which may be used in the construction of proposed exterior changes, additions or improvements;
* The size and locations of proposed exterior changes, additions or improvements; and
* Information about the procedures used by the ACC in reviewing applications for proposed exterior changes, additions or improvements.

The ACC has been delegated the authority to review and approve applications for new structures, changes, additions, or improvements to the exterior of the property which are not explicitly described by these Guidelines, and to consider additional guidelines in the review process whether published or not. These Guidelines may be amended by the DRC and ACC as is deemed necessary and appropriate.

### A. Application Procedure

**1. Submission.**
All applications for approval to make any exterior changes including color, additions or improvements must be submitted to the ACC in writing by completing the application form currently in use by the ACC (see Attachment I). Plans and specifications for any exterior change, addition or improvement should be attached to the application. The application should be supported by the following information:

1.  Drawing(s) of the proposed structure showing the top, front, side, and rear exterior views;
2.  Overall dimensions (length, width, height) of the structure; and the layout and dimension of supporting structures (e.g. beams, rafters, trusses, etc.);
3.  A copy of an official survey of the Lot showing location of easements, existing buildings and structures, and the proposed location of the improvement;
4.  A description of all materials used, including product name, model number, size, color, etc. Color samples (e.g. "paint chips") for all colors involved must be included.

The ACC reserves the right to request any additional information deemed by it to be necessary to properly evaluate the application. In the event that the ACC requests additional information and such information is not submitted to the ACC by the applicant in a timely manner, so that the original application may be approved or disapproved within 30 days of its receipt, the application shall be denied. However, the applicant may thereafter submit a new application with the requested information to the ACC for its review. It is in the applicant's best interest to submit the additional information as soon as possible, so as not to have the application process delayed. All applications shall be mailed or delivered to the office of the managing agent of the Association.

**2. ACC Decisions.**
ACC committee members shall consider each application for compliance with the Protective Covenants and with these Guidelines. The decision of a majority of members to approve or disapprove an application shall be considered the decision of the ACC. ACC decisions shall be conveyed in writing by the managing agent of the Association to the applicant and shall include a statement of the conditions under which the application is approved, if any, or the primary reason(s) for disapproving the application.

In accordance with the Protective Covenants, any application that is not approved or disapproved within 30 days of the date of its receipt shall be deemed to have been automatically approved. Unless otherwise stated in the ACC's written response, all approved exterior changes, additions or improvements shall be completed within 30 days of the date construction, installation or erection has commenced.

**3. Appeals.**
In the event that the ACC disapproves an application, the applicant may within 30 days submit an appeal to the DRC with any additional information the applicant considers relevant to the original application. The DRC shall consider at a meeting held within 30 days of receipt of the applicant's appeal, each appeal of an ACC decision, for compliance with the protective covenants and with these Guidelines. The decision of a majority of members in attendance at a duly held DRC meeting, where a quorum is present, shall be considered the decision of the DRC. Final DRC decisions shall be conveyed in writing by the managing agent of the Association to the applicant and shall include a statement of the conditions under which the application is approved, if any, or the primary reason(s) for disapproving the application.

**4.**
In the event that an appeal is denied by the DRC, the applicant may within 30 days from notice by the DRC submit an appeal to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall review the appeal at one of its next two meetings following the date upon which the appeal is received and notify the applicant of the Board's decision. All decisions of the Board of Directors shall be final.

**Status of Applications During Appeal.**
During the appeal period, the decision of the ACC on the original application shall remain in effect. Failure of the DRC or the Board of Directors to respond to a request for reconsideration within 30 days of the date of its receipt shall not automatically result in approval of the original application.

---

### B. General Guidelines

The ACC shall consider the following factors upon the review of each application for an exterior change, addition or improvement:

1.  The quality of construction and materials, colors, exterior design (elevations), size (dimensions), and location must be harmonious with existing and other proposed structures.
2.  The location must not violate the building set back lines, utility or drainage easements as shown on the official recorded plat, nor obstruct driver's vision at street intersections.
3.  The ACC may not grant permission to place an improvement upon or across any utility easement. Consent to encroach upon any utility easement must be obtained in writing from the owner of the easement (i.e. utility companies). The ACC may grant permission to place an improvement upon or across a drainage easement subject to the condition that the improvement must not impede drainage of any property served by the drainage easement (i.e., including adjacent lots). If deemed necessary in it's sole discretion, the Board may revoke consent to encroach upon any drainage easements. Removal of improvements (if required by the Board or owner of the easement) shall be solely the homeowner's responsibility, cost and expense.
4.  Improvements other than the main residence and garage may not exceed 8 feet in height (except as otherwise provided by the Protective Covenants).
5.  Improvements which are intended for other than single-family residential purposes, or which may become an annoyance or nuisance to the neighborhood are not permitted.
6.  Improvements must be located so that their use will not infringe upon the enjoyment of neighboring amenities nor place neighboring property at increased risk of damage.

---

### C. Fences

1.  **Wood Fence Construction.** Wooden fences facing the front street or along any side street or rear street property line or greenbelt shall be constructed with all pickets on the outside so that no posts or rails are visible from a street or a greenbelt. All fence design must also conform to all requirements as stated in the Protective Covenants.
2.  **Gates.** All gates shall be constructed with the same materials as the fence. The hinges and latches used on the gate should be of the same style and quality of those used throughout the Village.
3.  **Color.**
    * **a. Wood Fences.** No portion of a wood fence on a lot which is visible from any street or greenbelt may be painted or stained (including clear weatherproofing stains) without the prior approval of the ACC.
    * **b. Wrought Iron Fences.** Wrought iron fences must be black. The height, location and spacing of the bars of all wrought iron fences must be approved by the ACC. Wrought iron fences are not to be used around the perimeter of a lot.
4.  **Chain Link and Wire Fences.** There shall be no chain link or wire fences.
5.  **Setback Lines.** Fences must be replaced in their original locations. A change of location must be approved by the ACC. New fence construction must conform with all setbacks and other requirements as specified in the Protective Covenants. New fence construction, other than by the builder, must be approved by the ACC.
6.  **Maintenance of Fences.** Pickets, rails, or bars that are broken, warped, bent, sagging, or which have otherwise deteriorated must be repaired or replaced.
7.  **Height of Fences.** All perimeter fences shall not exceed six feet (6') in height. Fences between the house and garage may be between four to six feet (4'-6'). Whatever height is chosen for this area, it must be consistent for the entire run.

### D. Swimming Pools and Spas

An application for the construction of a swimming pool, spa or jacuzzi must include a plot plan showing the proposed location of the swimming pool, spa or jacuzzi in relation to the property lines, building lines, existing structures and existing or proposed fences. If any trees are to be removed or relocated, this must also be noted. The application shall also include a timetable for the construction of the pool, spa or jacuzzi.

No swimming pool, spa or jacuzzi shall be approved unless the area in which the pool is to be located is either enclosed by a six foot (6') fence constructed of wood or of wrought iron with a maximum of three inches (3") between each bar or such a fence is proposed to be constructed in conjunction with the swimming pool. There must be a drainage system below the ground providing drainage. Spas and jacuzzis must also have an adequate drainage system according to the requirements of any governmental agency having jurisdiction or, in the event there is no governmental agency having jurisdiction, as deemed appropriate by the ACC. Under no circumstances shall water from a swimming pool, spa or jacuzzi be permitted to drain onto the surface of the lot on which the swimming pool, spa or jacuzzi is situated or onto any adjacent lot.

During construction, the pool area shall be enclosed with a temporary fence or barrier, unless a fence already exists. If a portion of an existing fence is removed during construction, a temporary fence or barrier must be erected to fully enclose the area in which construction is taking place. No building materials shall be kept or stored on the street overnight. Excavated material shall either be used on-site or immediately removed from the premises by the pool contractor. The construction of all swimming pools must be in compliance with the National Electrical Code and include the installation of ground fault circuit interrupters.

3.  **Gutters.** When rain gutters are painted, their color must match the color of the fascia board trim. When "maintenance-free" gutters are installed or replaced, their color must match (as closely as possible) the fascia board trim or previously approved existing gutters.
4.  **Accents.** Shutters, window hoods, the side panels of doors and windows and the exterior surfaces of doors may be painted any ACC acceptable color. Window hoods may also be painted in a coppertone metallic based paint.
5.  **Outbuildings.** Any outbuilding or storage building which has a covered roof shall also be subject to these painting guidelines and shall be painted a color to match the overall color of the principal dwelling.

---

### H. Roofing Materials and Additions

### 5. Signs

a. A maximum of two (2) home security signs shall be permitted on each lot, provided they are small, inconspicuous, discretely placed signs for the purpose of warning of the presence of a home security system. Each sign shall be from a professional security company and should not exceed one (1) square foot in area. One (1) sign shall be allowed in the front yard and one (1) shall be allowed within the rear, fenced in portion of the lot. Each sign must be mounted on a stake; however, the top of the sign shall not exceed two feet (2') from the ground level when installed. Signs must be of an acceptable color which is harmonious with the surrounding structure and landscaping. The text and overall appearance of the signs must be acceptable and must primarily provide a security warning without prominent advertising of any business.

c. Contractor signs are permitted only during construction.

### 6. Solar Screen / Window Tint

The color of any solar screens or window tint must be harmonious with that of the house. The frames of the screens must match the window frames. If any window facing a street is covered, all of the windows on the same side of the building must also be covered. The width of the screen frames must match individual window size (i.e. double-width screens are not allowed). Frames should have appropriate cross-member support to prevent sagging. Window tint shall be harmonious and must be maintained to prevent peeling, cracking, or irregular discoloration.

### 7. Trees

Trees may not be removed without prior ACC approval, except to remove dead or diseased trees or to provide room for an improvement that has been approved by the ACC. When tree removal is required for the construction of an improvement, it must be disclosed in the application for that particular improvement. When trees are removed for any reason, the homeowner must also remove the remaining stump and fill any resulting hole.

A minimum of one (1) tree is required in the front yard of any residential lot.

### 8. Skateboard Ramps

Skateboard ramps are not allowed.

### 9. Exterior Siding

When exterior siding is replaced or added to any existing structure or new improvement on the Lot, it must be of the same type, quality, size and color as the existing siding on the main residence (unless all exterior siding is being replaced at one time). If all exterior siding is being replaced at one time, the type of siding to be used must be approved by the ACC. Vinyl-coated siding, aluminum, steel, or other metal siding shall not be acceptable. The following additional guidelines apply to replacement or additional exterior siding:

a. Thickness, visible width, and spacing of siding must be consistent with that of the original exterior siding. Each application submitted to the ACC shall include a sample of the proposed siding material.

b. Color of all siding (including siding that is not painted) must comply with the Guidelines for Painting as set forth herein. Each application must include a color sample of the proposed siding color.

c. Must be installed and maintained to avoid sagging, waving, warping or irregular coloration; the ACC may require the homeowner (at homeowner's sole responsibility and expense) to repair or replace siding that fails to adhere to these guidelines.
