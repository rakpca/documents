Annual assessments; and * b. Special assessments.</p> <p>The obligation to pay assessments, together with late charges and reasonable costs of collection, including counsel fees, shall be a charge upon the property and a continuing and contractual lien upon the property against which each assessment is made and shall run with title to the property. Each assessment, together with late charges and costs of collection, including counsel fees, shall also be the personal obligation of the Owner of the property at the time that the assessment becomes due, and the Owner's successor in title shall be jointly and severally liable for assessments due and payable at the time of conveyance.</p> <p>2. Purposes of Assessments. Assessments levied by the Association shall be used exclusively for the welfare and benefit of the Property and the Owners, for such purposes as the Association may determine appropriate in accordance with its articles of incorporation and by-laws, including (but not limited to) maintenance and lighting of streets within the Property and the rights of way of thoroughfares that are adjacent to the boundaries of the Property; police and security service; mosquito abatement; recreational programs and facilities; and other services, facilities, and activities as may be in the community's interest. The Board shall negotiate contracts for garbage and refuse removal and collection, which services shall not be paid out of any assessments, but which shall be billed by the contractor directly to each Owner.</p> <p>3. Maximum Annual Assessment. Until April 1, 1989, the maximum annual assessment shall be Two Hundred Sixteen and No/100 Dollars ($216.00) per Lot or Parcel; One Hundred Forty-four and No/100 Dollars ($144.00) per Apartment; and Two and 16/100 Dollars ($2.16) per one hundred square feet, or fraction thereof, of Commercial Land.</p> <p>From and after April 1, 1989, the maximum annual assessment shall be adjusted in conformance with the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, or by ten percent (10%), whichever is greater. The maximum assessment for any year shall be the amount determined by (a) taking the dollar amount specified in Section 3 above, (b) multiplying the amount by the published CPI-U number for December prior to the beginning of the subject year; and (c) dividing that resultant by the published CPI-U number for the month in which this Declaration was signed by the Declarant; or by multiplying the existing assessment by one hundred ten percent (110%), whichever is greater.</p> <p>From and after April 1, 1989, the regular annual assessment amounts specified above in Section 3 and used in the above adjustment formula may be changed by a vote of the members of the Association, provided that any such change shall have the assent of a majority of the votes of the members of the Association who are voting in person or by proxy, at a meeting duly called for this purpose, written notice of which shall be sent to all members not less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days in advance of the meeting setting forth the purpose of the meeting. The limitations hereof shall not apply to any change in the maximum and basis of the assessments undertaken as an incident to a merger or consolidation in which the Association is authorized to participate under its Articles of Incorporation. The Board of Directors may fix the annual assessment at an amount not in excess of the maximum.</p> <p>4. Special Assessments. In addition to the annual assessments, the Association may, in any assessment year, levy one or more special assessments applicable to that year only, to defray, in whole or in part, costs for necessary purposes of the replacement of a capital improvement in the Common Area; counsel fees and the fees of other retained experts; and similar costs that are necessary for the furtherance of the purposes of the Association. No special assessment shall be levied until it has been approved by a 2/3 majority of the votes represented in person or by proxy at a meeting duly called for the purpose of considering the levy of the special assessment.</p> <p>5. Notice and Quorum for Any Action Authorized Under Sections 3 and 4. Written notice of any meeting called for the purpose of raising the annual assessment by an amount that requires the vote of the Owners or of levying a special assessment shall be sent to all Owners not less than thirty days nor more than sixty days in advance of the meeting. At the first meeting called, a quorum shall be sixty percent of the votes in the Association, represented in person or by proxy. If the required quorum is not present at the meeting, a subsequent meeting may be called subject to the same notice requirement, and the required quorum at the subsequent meeting shall be one-half of the required quorum at the previous meeting. This procedure may be repeated until a quorum, as reduced, is present at a meeting. No subsequent meeting shall be held more than sixty days following the previous meeting.</p> <p>6. Uniform Rate of Assessment. Both annual and special assessments must be fixed and/or adjusted at proportionately uniform rates for all Lots, Parcels, Apartments or tracts of Commercial Land. The annual assessments levied against Lots owned by the Declarant, upon which construction of the residence has not commenced, shall be one-half (1/2) the annual Lot assessment.</p> <p>7. Date of Commencement of Annual Assessments: Due Dates. The annual assessments shall commence as to all Lots on the first day of the month following the conveyance of the first Lot. The annual assessment shall commence as to a Parcel, Apartment, or a tract of Commercial Land on the first day of the eighth month following the conveyance by Declarant to a subsequent Owner or on the first day of the fourth month following the issuance by the appropriate governmental authority of a building permit applicable to the land, or on the first day of the fourth month after building construction commences, whichever event occurs sooner. The first annual assessment shall be adjusted according to the number of months remaining in the calendar year. The Board shall fix the amount of the annual assessment against each Lot, Parcel, Apartment or tract of Commercial Land at least thirty (30) days in advance of each annual assessment period. Written notice of the annual assessment shall be sent to every Owner subject thereto. The due dates shall be established by the Board of Directors. The Association shall, upon demand, and for a reasonable charge, furnish a certificate signed by an officer or authorized agent of the Association setting forth whether the assessments on a specific Lot, Parcel, Apartment or tract of Commercial Land have been paid.</p> <p>8. Effect of Nonpayment of Assessments: Remedies of the Association. Any assessment not paid within thirty days after the due date shall bear a late charge calculated from the due date at the maximum rate of interest permitted by applicable law. To enforce payment, the Association may bring an action at law against the Owner or Owners personally obligated to pay any assessment, or it may foreclose its lien against the property subject to the assessment. No Owner may waive or otherwise escape liability for an assessment by reason of non-use of the Common Area or abandonment. To secure payment of the assessment, Declarant reserves, and shall reserve and assign to the Association in each deed by which property subject to assessment is conveyed, and each Owner, by acceptance of the property shall be deemed to have granted the Association, a vendor's lien and a continuing and contractual lien enforceable through judicial proceedings. If any Owner shall fail to pay any assessment, the Association may, in addition to foreclosing its liens and exercising the remedies provided in this Declaration and upon ten days prior written notice to the nonpaying Owner, exercise any other rights and remedies available at law or in equity. The liens are assignable by the Association in whole or in part.</p> <p>9. Notice of Lien. In addition to any other enforcement right that the Association may have, the Association may file a notice of claim or lien in the Official Public Records of Real Property of Harris County, Texas. The notice shall state the legal description of the property against which the claim or lien is made, the name(s) of the Owner(s), the amount of the claim or lien, including the accrued late charges and costs of collection, and shall be signed and acknowledged by an officer of the Association. The claim or lien shall continue until the amounts claimed and all subsequently accruing amounts shall be fully paid or otherwise satisfied. When all claims have been satisfied, the Association shall execute and record a notice releasing the claim or lien and shall charge a reasonable fee for the preparation and recording of the release.</p> <p>10. Subordination of the Lien to Mortgages. The assessment lien shall be subordinate to the lien of any first mortgage given for the purpose of purchase or improvements on the property subject to assessment. Mortgagees shall not be required by this Declaration to collect assessments from Owners, and the failure to pay assessments shall not by the terms of this Declaration constitute a default under a mortgage. The sale or transfer of any property subject to assessment, including the sale or transfer by mortgage foreclosure or any proceeding in lieu of foreclosure, shall extinguish neither the assessment lien nor payments which became due prior to the sale or transfer.</p> <p>11. Exempt Properties. All property dedicated to and accepted by a political Subdivision of the State of Texas or a municipal authority and all properties owned by charitable or non-profit organizations exempt from taxation by the laws of the State of Texas shall be exempt from the assessments created by this Declaration, except that no property or improvements devoted to dwelling use shall be exempt from assessment. The Board may make other exceptions when, in its sole determination, the exemption of the property from assessment is in the best interests of the Association.</p> <p>12. Addition to the Property. Additional land may be annexed by declaration without consent of the Members. Addition or annexation shall be accomplished by execution by Declarant and filing for record an instrument describing the land added or annexed.</p> <p>13. Deannexation of Land from the Association. Land previously added or annexed into the Association and made subject to this Declaration may be deannexed by an instrument signed and acknowledged on behalf of not less than 2/3 of the votes in the Association and filed in the Official Public Records of Real Property of Harris County, Texas.</p>"},{"location":"ccrs/#vi-general-provisions","title":"VI.

Applicability. This policy only applies to delinquent regular assessments, special assessments or other amounts owed the Association prior to the debt being turned over to a \"collection agent\" as that term is defined by Section 209.0064 of the Texas Property Code.</li> <li>2. Term. The term for a payment plan offered by the Association shall be a minimum of three (3) months and a maximum of six (6) months. The Owner shall determine whether the payment plan shall be for the maximum term of six (6) months or a shorter term.</li> <li>3. Payment Plan Agreement. The Owner shall be obligated to execute a payment plan agreement (\"Payment Plan Agreement\") which sets forth the total amount to be paid, the term of the payment plan, the due date for and amount of each payment, and the address to which payments are to be mailed or delivered. A payment plan shall not be effective until the Owner executes the required Payment Plan Agreement.</li> <li>4. Sums Included in Plan. The payment plan shall include all delinquent regular and/or special assessments and other sums owed to the Association as of the effective date of the Payment Plan Agreement. The payment plan shall not include any assessments which have not become due and payable to the Association as of the effective date of the Payment Plan Agreement. The Payment Plan Agreement shall provide that any assessments or other valid charges that become due and payable to the Association per the dedicatory instruments of the Association during the term of the payment plan must be paid in a timely manner.</li> <li>5. Grace Period. There will be a grace period of three (3) business days from the due date for a payment. If a payment is not received at the address set forth in the Payment Plan Agreement by the close of business on the third (3rd) business day following the date on which the payment is due, the Owner shall be deemed to be in default of the Payment Plan Agreement.</li> <li>6. Administrative Costs and Interest. The Association shall add to the delinquent assessments and other amounts owed to the Association to be paid in accordance with the Payment Plan Agreement reasonable costs for administering the payment plan, as follows: $20.00 for the preparation of a Payment Plan Agreement and $5.00 for receiving, documenting and processing each payment. During the term of the payment plan, interest at the rate provided in the Declaration or by law shall continue to accrue on delinquent assessments.</li> <li>7. Monthly Penalties. During the term of the payment plan, the Association shall not impose any monetary penalties with respect to the delinquent assessments and other charges included in the payment plan, except as provided in Section 6. Monetary penalties include late charges and fees otherwise charged by the management company and/or Association and added to the Owner's account as a result of the account being delinquent, if any.</li> <li>8. Default. If an Owner fails to make a payment to the Association by the end of the grace period applicable to the due date for that payment, the Owner shall be in default of the Payment Plan Agreement, at which point the Payment Plan Agreement shall automatically become void. The Association may notify the Owner that the Payment Plan Agreement is void as a result of the Owner's default, but notice to the Owner shall not be a prerequisite for the Payment Plan Agreement to become void. If the Association receives a payment after the expiration of the grace period and before the Association notifies the Owner that the Payment Plan Agreement is void, the Association may accept the payment and apply it to the Owner's account. The acceptance of a payment made by an Owner after the Payment Plan Agreement has become void shall not reinstate the Payment Plan Agreement.</li> <li>9. Owners Not Eligible for a Payment Plan.

Statements for assessments. The Association shall send a statement for the annual maintenance assessment to each Owner no later than March 1st of each year. The statement shall be forwarded to an Owner at the last known mailing address of the Owner according to the records of the Association. It is the responsibility of the Owner to notify the Association in writing of a change in the Owner's mailing address. The submission of a check which sets forth an address for the Owner that is different from the mailing address previously provided by the Owner to the Association does not constitute written notice of a change of the Owner's mailing address.</li> <li>2. Due Date. Annual maintenance assessments are due on April 1st of each year. An annual maintenance assessment which is not received by the Association by April 31st of the year in which the annual maintenance assessment becomes due shall be deemed to be delinquent and shall bear interest at the highest legal, non-usurious rate from the original due date (April 1st) until paid. A reasonable late fee in an amount to be determined by the Board may also be charged to the Owner of the property for which the annual maintenance assessment becomes delinquent.</li> <li>3. Payments. The Association may allow Owners to pay annual maintenance assessments which have not become delinquent over time, so long as the payment plan is approved and the Owner signs the Association's payment agreement. Payments must be made at least on a monthly basis. A fee of $5.00 will be charged for receiving and processing each payment.</li> <li>4. Application of Payments. A payment received from an Owner shall be applied in the following order of priority:<ul> <li>a. any delinquent assessment (annual assessment or special assessment);</li> <li>b. any current assessment (annual assessment or special assessment);</li> <li>c. any attorney's fees or third party collection costs incurred by the Association solely with assessments or any other charges that could provide the basis for foreclosure (i.e., charges secured by the Association's lien);</li> <li>d. any attorney's fees incurred by the Association that are not associated with assessments;</li> <li>e. any fines assessed by the Association; and</li> <li>f. any other amounts owed to the Association.</li> </ul> </li> <li>5. Insufficient Check. If an Owner submits a check in payment of all or some portion of the Owner's assessment account and the check is returned unpaid due to insufficient funds in the account, future payments of sums owed to the Association must be made by cashier's check or money order. The sum of $25.00 shall be charged to an Owner for a check returned due to insufficient funds.</li> <li>6. Notices. If an account becomes delinquent, a collection letter will be sent to the Owner of the property, the cost of which will be added to the Owner's assessment account. If an account remains delinquent on or after May 1st of the year in which the annual maintenance assessment becomes due, a Delinquency Notice shall be sent to the Owner. The Delinquency Notice shall be sent to the Owner by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall:<ul> <li>a. specify each delinquent amount and the total amount of the payment required to make the account current;</li> <li>b. advise the Owner of the availability of a payment plan in accordance with the Association's recorded Payment Plan Policy;</li> <li>c. provide a period of at least thirty (30) days to cure the delinquency before further collection action is taken; and</li> <li>d. advise the Owner that if, after the thirty (30) day period has expired, the Owner has not entered into a payment plan and account remains delinquent, the account will be referred to the Association's attorney and any fees and costs thereafter incurred by the Association will be added to the Owner's account in accordance with the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions.</li> </ul> </li> <li>7. Suspension of Privileges. If an Owner's assessment account becomes delinquent, the Association may also suspend the Owner's right to use the recreational facilities of the Association after giving written notice to the Owner in accordance with Section 209.006 of the Texas Property Code. The suspension of an Owner's right to use the recreational facilities of the Association shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, all other remedies available to the Association for non-payment of assessments.</li> <li>8. Attorney Action. If, after a Delinquency Notice is sent to an Owner, the Owner fails to respond to request a payment plan or pay the amount required to make the account current within thirty (30) days, the account will be referred to the Association's attorney for collection.

Each lot shall be used for single-family residence purposes, and no such residence shall be constructed on less than the equivalent of one full lot.</p> <p>2. No building shall be erected, altered or permitted to remain on any lot other than one detached single-family residential dwelling not to exceed two (2) stories in height, and a private garage for not more than three (3) cars and bona fide servants' quarters, which structure shall not exceed the main dwelling in height or number of stories.</p> <p>3. No building, shed, playhouse or such accessory structure or improvements of any character shall be erected or placed, or the erection thereof begun, or changes made in the design thereof after original construction, (including, but not by way of limitation, the color scheme and reroofing materials), on any lot until the construction plans and specifications and a plan showing the location of the structure or improvements have been submitted to and approved in writing by Friendswood, or its assignee hereinafter provided for. Such approval shall be as to compliance with these restrictions, the applicable Minimum Construction Standards adopted and promulgated from time to time by Friendswood, or its assignee, for such subdivision, and as to quality of materials, harmony of external design with existing and proposed structures, and as to location with respect to topography and finish grade elevation. Such approval shall not indicate Friendswood's approval for any other purpose and specifically, but without limitation, shall not be construed as any representation by Friendswood as to, or responsibility for, the design or quality of the improvements or the ultimate construction thereof. In the event Friendswood or its assignee fails to approve or disapprove such plans and specifications within thirty (30) days after the actual receipt thereof, approval shall not be required and the related covenants set out therein shall be deemed to have been fully satisfied.</p> <p>4. The living area of the main residential structure, exclusive of the porches, garage, and servants' quarters shall be not less than 1,800 square feet for a one-story dwelling, nor less than 2,000 square feet for a one-and-a-half or two-story structure. No more than one dwelling shall be built on any one lot or building site as defined in Paragraph 6 below.</p> <p>5. No building shall be located on any lot nearer to the front line or nearer to the street sideline than the minimum building setback line shown on the recorded plat. Any garage located closer than sixty (60) feet to the front property line shall not face nor open at less than a ninety (90) degree angle to the front property line. No building shall be located on any lot nearer than ten (10) feet to any side or rear street right-of-way line. Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 6, no building shall be located nearer than seven (7) feet to an interior lot line, except that a garage or other permitted accessory building located sixty (60) feet or more from the front lot line may be a minimum distance of three (3) feet from an interior lot line. For the purposes of this covenant, eaves, steps and unroofed terraces shall not be considered as part of a building, provided, however, that this shall not be construed to permit any portion of the construction on a lot to encroach upon another lot. Friendswood or its assignee at its sole discretion, is hereby permitted to approve deviations in building setback lines as hereinabove set out and building area and location in instances where, in its judgment, such deviation will result in a more common beneficial use which is not adverse to the subdivision as a whole. Such approvals must be granted in writing and, when given, will become a part of these restrictions.</p> <p>6. Any owner of one or more adjoining lots (or portions thereof) may consolidate such lots or portions into one single-family residence building site, with the privilege of placing or constructing improvements on such resulting site, in which case, setback lines shall be measured from the resulting side property lines rather than from the lot lines as indicated on the recorded plat.</p> <p>7. Easements for installation and maintenance of utilities are reserved as shown and provided for on the recorded plat, and/or provided by instruments of record or to be recorded, and no structure shall be erected on any of said easements. Neither Friendswood nor any utility company using the easement shall be liable for any damage done by either of them or their assigns, agents, employees or servants to shrubbery, trees, flowers, or improvements of the owner located on the land covered by said easements.</p> <p>Friendswood reserves unto itself, its successors and assigns, as well as unto Harris County Municipal Utility District No. 350, Houston Lighting &amp; Power Company, Entex, Central Telephone Company of Texas, Kingwood Cablevision, Inc., and any other accredited public utility company, their successors and assigns, the right at all times to use any and all areas shown on said recorded map or plat of Kings Point Village, Section Nine, as a utility easement or other area dedicated to the public use, for the purpose of laying, placing, installing, maintaining, repairing, replacing or constructing all kinds and types of power lines, telephone lines, television lines, audio or video communications lines, gas lines, water and sewer lines, mains or pipes as well as other equipment necessary or incidental to the operation and maintenance of utilities, water and sewer service and/or supply system, collection system and its appurtenances, to service, furnish or supply this addition and any and all adjoining or contiguous property with such services.</p> <p>Utility companies furnishing electric, gas, telephone and audio-visual communications services in the subdivision shall have easements granted by recorded instruments and/or as shown on the recorded subdivision plat. Further, an electric distribution system has been installed in Kings Point Village, Section Nine, which service area embraces all of the lots which are platted in Kings Point Village, Section Nine, by the execution of an agreement between Houston Lighting &amp; Power Company and Friendswood. This electrical distribution system consists of overhead primary feeder circuits constructed on wood or steel poles, single or three phase, as well as underground primary and secondary circuits, pad mounted or other types of transformers, junction boxes, and such other appurtenances necessary to make underground service available.</p> <p>The owner of each lot containing a single dwelling unit shall, at its own cost, furnish, install, own and maintain (all in accordance with the National Electrical Code) the underground service cable and appurtenances from the point of electric company's metering at the structure to the point of attachment at such company's installed transformers or energized secondary junction boxes, such point of attachment made available by the electric company at a point designated by such company at the property line of each lot. The electric company furnishing service shall make the necessary connections at said point of attachment and at the meter. Friendswood has either by designation on the plat of the subdivision or by separate instrument granted necessary easements to the electric company providing for the installation, maintenance and operation of its electric distribution system and has also granted to the various homeowners reciprocal easements providing for access to the area occupied by and centered on the service wires of the various homeowners to permit installation, repair and maintenance of each homeowner's owned, and installed service wires. In addition, the owner of each lot shall at his or its own cost, furnish, install, own and maintain a meter loop (in accordance with the then current Standards and Specifications of the electric company furnishing service) for the location and installation of the meter of such electric company for each dwelling unit involved.</p> <p>For so long as underground service is maintained in the subdivision, the electric service to each dwelling unit therein shall be underground, uniform in character and exclusively of the type known as single phase, 120/240 volt, three wire, 60 cycle, alternating current.</p> <p>The electric company has installed the underground electric distribution system in the subdivision at no cost to Friendswood (except for certain conduits, where applicable, and except as hereinafter provided) upon Friendswood's representation that the underground residential subdivision is being developed for residential dwelling units designed to be permanently located where originally constructed (such category of dwelling units expressly to exclude mobile homes) which are built for sale or rent.</p> <p>The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs also apply to any future residential development in Reserve(s) shown on the plat of Kings Point Village, Section Nine, as such plat exists at the execution of the agreement for underground electric service between the electric company and Friendswood or thereafter. Specifically, but not by way of limitation, if a lot owner in a former Reserve undertakes some action which would have invoked a front lot foot payment if such action has been undertaken in the underground residential subdivision, such owner or applicant for service shall pay the electric company $1.75 per front lot foot, unless Friendswood has paid the electric company as above described. The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs do not apply to any future non-residential development in such Reserve(s).</p> <p>Easements for the underground service may be crossed by driveways and walkways provided the developer or builder makes prior arrangements with the utility companies furnishing electric, gas, cablevision and telephone services and provides and installs any necessary conduit of approved type and size under such driveways or walkways prior to construction thereof. Such easements for the underground service shall be kept clear of all other improvements, including buildings, patios or other pavings, and neither Friendswood nor any utility company using the easements shall be liable for any damage done by either of them or their assigns, their agents, employees or servants, to shrubbery, trees, flowers or other improvements (other than crossing driveways or walkways providing conduit has been installed as outlined above) of the owner located on the land covered by said easements. The audio and video communication company furnishing such services and facilities shall have a two foot (2') wide easement along and centered on the underground wire or cable when and as installed by said company from the utility easement to the point of connection on the permanent improvement or structure constructed, or to be constructed, upon said lot.</p> <p>8. No activity, whether for profit or not, shall be permitted on any lot which is not related to single-family residence purposes, except on those lots which may be designated by Friendswood, its successors or assigns, to be used for sales or construction offices for a period of time commensurate with its home construction program. No noxious or offensive activity of any sort shall be permitted, nor shall anything be done on any lot which may be or become an annoyance or nuisance to the neighborhood.</p> <p>9. No structure of a temporary character, trailer, basement, tent, shack, garage, barn or other outbuilding shall be used on any lot at any time as a residence. Any building, shed, playhouse, accessory structure or improvement, other than the main residence and garage shall be limited to eight (8) feet in height above natural ground unless otherwise approved by Friendswood, its successors and assigns, and must be approved in accordance with Paragraph 3, Part I of these Protective Covenants.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no animals or fowl may be kept on the property which result in any annoyance or are obnoxious to residents in the vicinity.</p> <p>11. No wall, fence, planter, or hedge in excess of two (2) feet in height shall be erected or maintained nearer to the front lot line than the front building setback line. No side or rear fence, wall or hedge shall be more than six (6) feet high. No side fence facing a street shall be erected or maintained nearer to the street than the side building setback line. No fence shall be of wire or chain link construction. No fence shall be constructed on lots adjoining the greenbelt without prior written approval of Friendswood or its assignee.

No object or thing shall be placed or planted on corner lots which obstructs sight lines at elevations between two (2) and six (6) feet above the top of the street curb within the triangular area formed by the junction of street curb lines and a line connecting them at points twenty-five (25) feet from the junction of the street curb lines (or extension thereof).</p> <p>13. The drying of clothes in public view is prohibited, and the owners or occupants of any lots at the intersection of streets or adjacent to parks, playgrounds or other facilities where the rear yard or portion of the lot is visible to the public shall construct and maintain a drying yard or other suitable enclosure to screen drying clothes from public view.</p> <p>14. All lots shall be kept at all times in a sanitary, healthful, attractive and safe condition, and the owner or occupant of all lots shall keep all weeds, grass and dead trees thereon cut and shall in no event use any lot for storage of material and equipment except for normal residential requirements or incident to construction of improvements thereon as herein permitted, or permit the accumulation of garbage, trash or rubbish of any kind thereon, and shall not burn any garbage, trash, leaves or rubbish except by use of an incinerator approved by Friendswood, its successors or assigns, and then only during such conditions as permitted by law. All yard equipment, storage piles and woodpiles shall be kept screened by a service yard or other similar facility as herein otherwise provided, so as to conceal them from view of neighboring lots, streets or other property. Woodpiles shall be neatly maintained.</p> <p>In the event of default on the part of the owner or occupant of any lot in observing the above requirements or any of them, such default continuing after ten (10) days written notice thereof, Friendswood or its assignee, may without liability to the owner or occupant in trespass or otherwise, enter upon said lot and cut, or cause to be cut, such weeds and grass, and remove or cause to be removed such garbage, trash and rubbish or do any other thing necessary to secure compliance with these restrictions so as to place said lot in a neat, attractive, healthful, safe and sanitary condition, and may charge the owner or occupant of such lot for the cost of such work. The owner or occupant, as the case may be, agrees by the purchase or occupancy of the property to pay such statement immediately upon receipt thereof. To secure the payment of such charges in the event of nonpayment by the property owner, a vendor's and a continuing and contractual lien are herein and hereby retained against the above-described property in favor of Friendswood or its assignee but inferior to any purchase money lien or mortgage. Any foreclosure of any such prior or superior lien under the power of sale of any mortgage, deed of trust or other security instrument, or through other court proceedings shall not cut off and extinguish the liens securing said charge which became due and payable prior to such foreclosure date should such funds resulting from the foreclosure be available, and no such foreclosure shall free any lot and/or unit from the liens securing said charge thereafter becoming due and payable, nor shall the personal obligation of the owner foreclosed be extinguished by any foreclosure.</p> <p>15. No sign, advertisement, billboard or advertising structure of any kind shall be displayed to the public view on any portion of the properties or on any lot except one sign for each building site, which sign may have one maximum dimension of twenty-four (24) inches and a maximum area of 576 square inches, advertising the property for sale or rent, except signs used by Friendswood, its successors or assigns, to advertise the property during the construction and sales period.
